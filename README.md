### I'm a UX Practitioner based in Tulsa, OK, focused on #CivicTech and #DesignForGood. My interests include anything to do with aviation and future transport methods, with an emphasis on how we can create a sustainable way of living on our planet. 

I can assist your work by using my UX skillset to set you up for success **before** you begin expensive development projects or provide UX audits for existing projects, to help identify areas of improvement, to reduce the cost of redevelopment.
