### I'm a UX leader based in Tulsa, OK, focused on #CivicTech and #DesignForGood. 

For **new** projects, I can help set you up for success before you start an expensive development project by coaching your team on UX best practices. I'm also available to conduct freelance UX research. 

For **existing** projects, I can conduct UX audits to identify areas for improvement, and reduce the cost of redevelopment significantly.
