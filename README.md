### I'm a UX Practitioner based in Tulsa, OK, focused on #CivicTech and #DesignForGood. My interests include cybersecurity, aviation, and future transportation methods, with an emphasis on how we can create a safe and sustainable way of living on our planet. 

I can assist your work by using my UX skillset to set you up for success _before_ you begin expensive development projects or provide UX audits for existing projects, to help identify areas of improvement, and reduce the cost of redevelopment.
