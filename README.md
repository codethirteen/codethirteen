### I'm a user experience leader
I take on projects that include human-centered development to improve our planet and our lives. I am specifically interested in future mobility and urban innovation. 

#### If you're looking to contribute to human-centered, you can find projects using these hashtags: [#CivicTech](https://github.com/search?q=%23CivicTech&type=repositories) and [#DesignForGood](https://designforgood.org/). 
#### If you're looking for human-centered roles, you can find them at[Design Gigs for Good Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/design-gigs-for-good). 

#### I communicate well with Product, UX, and engineering teams, to ensure smooth communication across all phases of product development. In my freelance life, I am comfortable taking projects from UX research all the way to coded solutions.
